    "# Web Scraper for CMS Medicare Preventive Services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Page that we're scraping: \n",
    "https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Prevention/PrevntionGenInfo/medicare-preventive-services/MPS-QuickReferenceChart-1.html\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose\n",
    "Scrape the website for CMS Medicare preventive services (30 pages, one for each service, as of Jan 2019). This will consolidate the HCPCS codes, diagnosis codes, and waived vs. applied member payments into a spreadsheet. These codes will help carve out preventive services for claims grouping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "* Excel tab with a grid of all attributes (e.g., covered hcpcs and icd codes) for each service as printed on the site\n",
    "* Excel tab with hcpcs codes formatted into a comma-separated list that's friendlier for the grouper\n",
    "* Run time: 6-8 minutes for 30 links; <1 minute if testing on 1-2 links.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background \n",
    "* Our website has JavaScript that produces HTML. \n",
    "    * This means we need a browser to render the JavaScript for the final HTML. \n",
    "    * Viewing the source HTML code will not get us the final rendered HTML that a user interacts with on their browser.\n",
    "* There is one home URL and each individual service has a URL that is the home URL concatenated with the service alias. E.g., \"home_url.com.html#service\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "* Use BeautifulSoup to scrape the CMS site for names and aliases of services (Alcohol Misuse = 'alc_misuse'). Store these in a dictionary called 'services'.\n",
    "* Create a dictionary call 'svc_dict'with each service as a key and store it's link.\n",
    "    * We will later open via Selenium/Firefox. Do this by appending the service to the base/home URL.\n",
    "    * We will also add other attributes to this dictionary like HCPCS and ICD codes that are relevent to the service\n",
    "* Create a function get_info(service, link) that opens a URL, creates a selenium browser object, and fetches the elements we want and stores those in our 'svc_dict' for one given service.\n",
    "* iterate through all links and services and call get_info() to populate our dictionary\n",
    "* lastly, create 'svc_dict2' which will do some text parsing on hcpcs codes only to make a neater comma-separated list of hcpcs codes related to each service\n",
    "* convert 'svc_dict' and 'svc_dict2' to dataframes and export to excel (two tabs)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pre-requisites\n",
    "* install selenium and beautifulsoup4 packages\n",
    "    * e.g., \"conda install selenium\"\n",
    "    * \"conda install beatifiulsoup4\"\n",
    "* beautifulsoup supports the Firefox browser, but you need to download a geckodriver.exe and store the executable where your python path is located\n",
    "    * Download here: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.21.0\n",
    "    * Try v21 geckodriver first. The latest is v23, but it seems to cause issues on certain Windows PCs"
